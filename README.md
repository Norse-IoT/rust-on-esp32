# rust-on-esp32
Running Rust on ESP32 by the Norse IoT club

To Do:
- create a docker container
  - create a template directory
  - copy all code into docekr container
  - build container to image esp32 -> Question, will this be different across OSes?
- all projects use this as a template from now on
